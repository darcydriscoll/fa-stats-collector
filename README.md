# FurAffinity Stats Collector

If you want to create timeseries data for your stats on FurAffinity, you can use this little bookmarklet that grabs all the stats for you and saves a lot of time. It does it with Promise-based asynchronous programming, some of which I adapted from Dan Flanagan's book, 'Javascript: The Definitive Guide (7ed)'.

Just create a bookmark, make the content of the .js file the URL, and click on the bookmarklet on the furaffinity.net domain!
